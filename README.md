# SolvingPDEs

Matlab files for the final project of numerical analysis course. The goal is to use different numerical methods (Crank-Nicholson, Lax-Friedrichs, Leap-frog) to solve heat and transport partial differential equations. The exact periodic solution for the transport animation (sol_e) needs fixing.
